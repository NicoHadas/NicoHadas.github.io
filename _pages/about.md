I am  a Bioinformatics Research Tech II in the [Horani Lab](https://horanilab.wustl.edu/), where we investigate the complexties of genetic ciliopathies. I am also a Master of Science student in Biomedical Informatics ([DBBS](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/programs/biomedical-informatics-data-science/)) at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. 

My primary research interest is in developing deep learning frameworks to model cellular function and better understand disease pathogenesis.

I have previously researched at the National Research Council of Canada and completed my undergrad in Biochemistry + Bioinformatics at the University of Waterloo.
